Many travelers donâ€™t realize that using a proxy can help them buy cheap flight tickets by changing their virtual location. This lets you see different prices on airline websites that arenâ€™t available in your real region, bypassing geographic restrictions and cutting travel costs. It sounds technical, but once you know how to use it, the savings can be impressive. Hereâ€™s a quick look at how proxies work and how they helped me save.

## What Is a Proxy and How Does It Work?

A proxy server acts as a middleman between your device and the internet. Instead of connecting directly to a website, your requests go through the proxy, which hides your real IP address and replaces it with one from another location. This allows you to appear browsing from a different country, unlocking prices or content restricted by region.

By choosing a proxy IP from a country with cheaper fares, you can buy cheap flight tickets that wouldnâ€™t show up otherwise.

## How I Used [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=Web2.0&utm_medium=Github&utm_id=james2k4) to Buy Cheap Flight Tickets to Paris

I heard VPNs could help get cheaper flights, and since 9Proxy works similarly, I gave it a try. I connected via 9Proxy, selected an IP from a region with lower prices, and browsed airline sites. The ticket prices were significantly cheaper than when browsing from Vietnam, saving me a good amount on my flight to Paris.

9Proxy impressed me with its reliable connection, variety of IPs, and ease of use. Setup is simple: download the app, create an account, buy an IP package, select and forward the IP, then use it with antidetect tools like Dolphyn. This way, your online location appears wherever you want.
